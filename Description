For this project, you will have to implement three operations over large graphs.

1.- Display the k-hop neighborhood of a given node u.
2.- Find and display a path of length k, that has node u as one of the endpoints
3.- Display a subgraph containing an independent set of size k that includes node u. 
    Display the nodes in the independent set with a different color. 

For your experiments, you will use the TWITTER-REAL-GRAPH-PARTIAL graph which has 580.8k nodes and the ROADNET-PA graph which has 1.1M nodes.
